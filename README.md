## Getting Started
    This guide walks you through setting up your development environment and running your React Native app built 
    with Expo on your device.

### Prerequisites
 - Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system
 - You can verify their versions by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal.
 - If not installed, download them from the official Node.js website [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Project Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
3. Start the development server using Expo CLI

 ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/InsafNilam/gastro-go](https://github.com/InsafNilam/gastro-go.git)
   cd my-react-native-app
   npx expo start
 ```
### Running the App on Your Device:

1.  Install the Expo Go App:
    - Download and install the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device from the respective app stores:
      - Google Play Store for Android
      - Apple App Store for iOS
2.  Connect to the Development Server:
  - Ensure your device and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
3. Scan the QR Code:
  - Open the Expo Go app on your device.
  - In the terminal, locate the displayed QR code.
  - Use the Expo Go app's built-in camera scanner (Android) or your device's camera app (iOS) to scan the QR code.
  - Once scanned, your app will launch on your device, allowing you to make live edits to the code and see the changes reflected immediately.

# Additional Tips:
Code Changes: Any changes you make to your project's code will be automatically reflected in the running app on your device, eliminating the need to manually refresh.
